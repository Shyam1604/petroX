You can place your order online and get fuel delivered at your location in specialized Refuellers (petroX Tankers) according to your chosen schedule. We are making refueling smarter!.</p>

                <li>
                  <p>petroX sources fuel from authorized and selected dealers of oil companies near your location. We follow a strict quality assurance program to ensure every drop of fuel is checked for quality before it gets loaded into our Refuellers for delivery. We do not purchase or stock fuel prior to delivery. Fuel is sourced only upon receiving orders from customers.</p>

              <a href='#'>Is doorstep refuelling a dangerous new concept ?</a>
              <ul class='sub-items'>
                <li>
                  <p>Doorstep refueling is neither dangerous nor is it a new concept. Let us compare it with more hazardous gas fuel LPG. Over 18 million metric tonnes of LPG is consumed in India. LPG is a pressurized gas and has the risk of a BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion) Despite that, it is safely delivered to homes by thousands of small trucks that carry 2,000 to 20,000 liters of LPG. LPG is also being delivered to many consumers in metro cities through piped connection to the consumer's kitchen. In comparison, we carry the delivery of liquid fuel in small tanks of less than 2,000 Litre capacity. Diesel and Petrol are not pressurized and are much safer to transport, especially in small quantities. Our Operators are IRTE trained, in addition to being extensively training on the safe handling of fuel. Our Refuellers are designed and fabricated as per guidelines in the Petroleum Act and Rules by PESO (Petroleum Explosive Safety Organization of India). Additionally, they are equipped with spill containment kits, fire extinguishers, and first aid to ensure complete compliance and safety. Doorstep delivery of fuel has already been implemented in countries like the USA, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>

              <a href='#'>Is doorstep delivery of Diesel and Petrol safe ?</a>
              <ul class='sub-items'>
                <li>
                  <p>Doorstep delivery of fuel like diesel/ petrol is safe. When you go to a petrol pump for filling your car, you expose yourself to a place where tens of thousands of liters of Petrol and Diesel are stored in decades-old underground tanks. You see tens of vehicles getting filled simultaneously causing the constant presence of inflammable vapor in large quantities. You may also notice several vehicles keeping their engines running while waiting to fill fuel, creating a potential hazard of fire. Now imagine a vehicle carrying a few hundreds of liters of fuels in airtight containers coming to deliver at your doorsteps. First, such a small amount of fuel dispensed to your equipment reduces the vapor generation or accumulation to nil. Second, there are no potential fire sources to cause ignition. These factors together nullify the possibility of any fire during doorstep delivery.</p>

              <a href='#'>Is there a risk equipment exploding while refueling ?</a>
              <ul class='sub-items'>
                <li>
                  <p>No. More than 5,00,000 accidents happen in India every year caused by more than 200 million vehicles on the road. Fire accidents or vehicle explosions during transportation of fuel is so low that there are no statistics available. Liquid fuel vehicles do not explode like they do in the movies! In the case of Diesel, which not only requires mixture with air but also compression to over 250 degrees Celsius to achieve autoignition temperature, the possibility of fire or explosion is almost nil.</p>

              <ul class='sub-items'>
                <li>
                  <p>We accept payment by NEFT, Online - Net Banking Payment, Online - Card/UPI Payment, and Cheque at the time of delivery. If you prefer paying Online using Cards, we recommend you to check with your bank if they levy surcharges on your card. If there is any surcharge by the bank/intermediary, it will be borne by you (customer).
                    For our suggested Payment Gateway partners in the app/website (option called Pay Online Now)- any excess charge incurred by the payment mechanism is displayed as "convenience fee" at the time of choosing the payment method. The same is payable by you (customer) over and above our charges and is collected by the Payment Gateway provider, and not by petroX as a service charge.
